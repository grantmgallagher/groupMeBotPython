This is a first go at implementing a basic bot in GroupMe. 
The API for GroupMe can be found at https://dev.groupme.com/

This bot listens for users that say "Bot, {action} @user" and then either insults or compliments the user, based upon the request.
The Procfiles here are used for deploying to Heroku
